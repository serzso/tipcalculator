# Tipcalculator

### This app helps you calculate the tip and split the total amount if you wish

#### Summery 

Ever been in a situation when you had to calculate the tip amount and were just unable to get the right number? (🍷 Probably because you had too much wine in that charmy little restaurant 😉)

With this simple app you can easily get the right amount and the best thing is that you can simply change the percent you wish to give to the waiter or waitress. 🍳

Ordered together but would like to pay separately? Never have been easier! Select the correct number and booooom there it is. No more debates on the dirty wherewithal. 🤑


#### How to use it? 🧐

1. Type in your bill amount

2. Select tippercent

3. Select number of people

4. Don't forget to pay...🤪


#### What did I learn? 👩🏻‍💻

First of all I would like to highlight that I made the body of this project with [Devslopes][link1]'s help. 


#### We practised: 🏋

- How to use MVC.

- How to deal with stack views properly.

- How to use computed properties.

- Impelementing UISlider. 

#### What did I do on my own? 💪🏻


- DismissKeyboard when it is needed. (Clicking anywhere or changing the tippercent)

- Implementing a function which makes the total bill amount splited into desired sections. 

- Searching for online picture editors which allow you to have your picture in different sizes for only one click and change 
color if needed. (My favorite one is [this][link2].)
